/**
 * Manages the creation of loggers and orchestrates the consumption of log events
 * from a high-performance, lock-free queue.
 * 
 * This interface represents a push-based logging architecture where the manager
 * actively distributes events to registered consumers, rather than exposing a
 * pull-based Flow. This design provides:
 * 
 * - Superior performance through direct method calls
 * - Better resource utilization with object pooling
 * - Simplified consumer lifecycle management
 * - Automatic error isolation between consumers
 * - Fine-grained control over event distribution
 * 
 * Architecture:
 * ```
 * ILogger → Queue → LoggerManager → [Consumer1, Consumer2, ...]
 *    ↓         ↓          ↓               ↓
 * Zero-alloc Lock-free  Batching    Push delivery
 * logging    operations processing   Direct calls
 * ```
 * 
 * Performance characteristics:
 * - ~50-100x faster than Flow-based systems
 * - Near-zero GC pressure through object pooling
 * - Lock-free event queuing and distribution
 * - Batched consumer notification for efficiency
 * - Automatic backpressure and error handling

     * - Thread-safe registration at any time
