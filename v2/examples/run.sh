# The ONE E2E launcher (AGENTS.md section 3).
#
# It runs real .pipeline.kts programs against the compiled distribution. It is
# deliberately not a framework: it discovers scenarios, gives each one a
# private control root, checks the exit code, and cleans up. It has no notion of
# assertions beyond two optional per-pipeline directives, so a scenario cannot
# grow into a test suite with its own vocabulary.
#
#   //@ expect-exit 1                 default is 0
#   //@ expect-stderr <substring>     the refusal must be this specific, not
#                                     merely a nonzero exit
#   //@ durable                       run twice against one control root and
#                                     require the second run not to repeat the
#                                     effect; the pipeline itself asserts the
#                                     count, this only re-runs it
#   //@ requires-seeded-credentials   NOT_RUN: the scenario needs a credential
#                                     store seeded in advance, and the product
#                                     offers no non-interactive way to seed one
#                                     (`credentials add` prompts on the TTY).
#                                     It is reported as not executed, which is
#                                     neither a pass nor a failure.
#
# The distribution must already exist:
#     cd v2 && ./gradlew :pipeline-application:installDist
#
# Why `//@` and not `#!`. An earlier revision read directives from `#!` comment
# lines, on the assumption that the product supported them. It does not: no
# source under any `src/main` reads `#!`. The convention only ever worked by
# accident, because the Kotlin script compiler strips a shebang from the FIRST
# line of a file. That accident is a one-line budget, and it was spent wrongly:
# two `#!` lines make the second one an ordinary syntax error, so a scenario
# carrying both `expect-exit` and `expect-stderr` failed to COMPILE with
# "Syntax error: Expecting an element" instead of failing for its own reason.
# Measured, not assumed: two `#!` lines give VALIDATION FAILED; the same two as
# `//` comments give VALIDATION SUCCESSFUL.
#
# `//@` is an ordinary Kotlin comment, so it is position-independent, repeatable
# and always legal. The `@` is load-bearing rather than decorative: real
# scenarios already carry prose comments such as
# "// durable execution over the journal", so a bare `//` prefix would let a
# sentence in a comment silently switch a directive on.
