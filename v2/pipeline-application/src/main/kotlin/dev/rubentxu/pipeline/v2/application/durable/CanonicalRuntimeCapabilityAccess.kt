/**
 * CDE.3-d1: explicit, small capability bridge from a [CanonicalRuntimeContext] to a
 * [StepCapabilityAccess].
 *
 * It exposes ONLY the capabilities the canonical runtime actually declares and provides today
 * ([EVENT_SINK_CAPABILITY] backed by the runtime's [CanonicalRuntimeContext.eventSink], and — since
 * LB-02 / A4 — [SHELL_OPERATIONS_CAPABILITY] backed by a fresh [ShOperationsAdapter] constructed
 * from the runtime context). It derives the capability values from the runtime context WITHOUT
 * handing the whole [CanonicalRuntimeContext] to a handler and without rebuilding a pipeline
 * context. Direction is contract.requiredCapabilities -> capability admission ->
 * [StepCapabilityAccess] -> handler; a handler must never receive the raw runtime context.
 *
 * Lookup is fail-closed: [get] on a capability that is not available throws rather than returning a
 * nullable/`Any?` sentinel, so a handler can only ever start once capability admission has confirmed
 * availability.
